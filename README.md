Hello,

Thank you for your response. My Roblox username is DmitroMeow.

The item in question is this emote: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/94455216984473/.
In the mobile “Try On” preview, the emote is shown as looped (playing continuously), which made me believe it works as a “sit” animation that lasts until I cancel it.

However, after purchasing, I discovered that in the actual game the emote stops after 5 seconds and is not looped. This behavior is not stated in the description and is different from what is shown in the preview.

Because the preview is misleading and does not represent the actual functionality, I believe this is a platform-side issue, not user error.
I kindly request either:

1. A refund for this purchase, or


2. A fix to the preview or the item so that it matches the expected looped behavior.



I can provide a video comparison showing the Try On preview and the actual in-game behavior if needed.

Thank you for reviewing this issue.

Kind regards,
DmitroMeow
