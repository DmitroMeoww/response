Thanks for redirecting to GitHub.

So let's me explain what happened.. 
My friend username @vikelmnqkg5
And she's google account got hacked, she didn't linked phone number and forgot password, so she doesn't have access to gmail. So reseting she cant.
I would ask some questions:
1. Do she actually can reset password if she prove thats her account?
2. What proof she can send to approve

Faq:

1. I don't need her account, i just tipping how to do it for her
2. She logged in, so she will ask moderation from her account (yes i just asking tips)
3. She's google account is @ira745045gmail.com

Please ask questions to @dmitromeow@gmail.com
Thank for your advice!
